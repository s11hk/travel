            <h1>Honnō-ji Temple</h1>
            <p>Honnō-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple located in the city of Fushimi, Kyoto, Japan. It is one of the most famous temples in Kyoto and is known for its beautiful gardens and serene atmosphere. Besides, Honnō-ji is most famous for the Honnō-ji incident, the assassination of the powerful warlord Oda Nobunaga, which occurred there on 21 June 1582. Nobunaga lodged at the temple with little protection before his invasion of the west, but was betrayed by his general Akechi Mitsuhide, who moved in superior forces by subterfuge, besieged the temple, and set it on fire. Knowing there was no way out for him, Nobunaga committed seppuku along with his attendant Mori Ranmaru. In 1591, Nobunaga's successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered the reconstruction of Honnō-ji, but on a different site due to the tragic circumstances. Honnō-ji was rebuilt on its current location in present-day Nakagyō Ward, near Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae Station.</p></div>

                            <p>The main hall is open to the public and you can move around the inside freely, but please remember to show a quiet respect for the Buddhist altar. When I went there, no one was there. I opened the sliding door, and sat on the floor for a while. Then I prayed for the repose of Nobunaga and his brave African retainer, Yasuke. Nobunaga’s memorial grave sits unobtrusively in the temple's inner grounds, behind the main hall.</p>

                            <p>The original location of Honnō-ji Temple was about 1 km west of the current temple. The spot has completely changed and there is just a small shop focusing on Nobunaga there. The shop, called “Shincho Saryo”, has a restaurant, café, and exhibition room related to Nobunaga. And interestingly, there is a memorial stone downstairs, modeled after “Bon-san.” Bon-san was a large stone kept at Nobunaga’s Azuchi-jo Castle in Shiga (it doesn’t exist today). The shopkeeper said that people who really love Nobunaga get together at this shop and grieve for his soul. Bon-san was actually a symbol of Nobunaga in those days. When Nobunaga was out of the castle, retainers thought Bon-san was there in place of him, and so they carried out their duties as if he was there.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>A visit to Honnō-ji Temple offers more than just a glimpse into the famous incident. The grounds are home to several noteworthy memorials and statues that provide insight into different aspects of Japanese history and culture. One such memorial commemorates the visit of a tongsinsa delegation from Korea in 1719, consisting of 346 members who came to pay respects to the new shogun, Tokugawa Yoshimune. This monument serves as a reminder of the diplomatic relations between Japan and Korea during the Edo period. As visitors stroll up Teramachi from Shijo to explore these memorials, they can also enjoy the unique atmosphere created by the blend of historical significance and modern urban life that characterizes this area of Kyoto.

For a modest fee of 500 yen, visitors can explore this treasure house, which is particularly notable for its second floor exhibition. Inside, visitors will find a carefully curated collection of artifacts related to Nobunaga. These include elaborate byobu screens, intricately crafted swords, and decorative scrolls.

                            <p>The Takuramonokan not only houses these historical treasures but also serves as a space for contemplation and education. Information panels and displays help contextualize the artifacts, allowing visitors to better understand their significance in relation to Nobunaga's life and the broader historical period. While the main temple grounds are free to explore, the Takuramonokan's modest entry fee is well worth it for history enthusiasts and those seeking a deeper understanding of Nobunaga's impact on Japanese culture and history. The intimate setting of this small museum creates an atmosphere of close encounter with history, making it a highlight of any visit to Honnoji Temple.</p>
