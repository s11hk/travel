        <p>Oda Nobunaga (織田信長 23 June 1534 – 21 June 1582) was a Japanese daimyō and one of the leading figures of the Sengoku and Azuchi-Momoyama periods. He was the Tenka-bito (person under heaven) and regarded as the first "Great Unifier" of Japan. Sometimes referred as the "Demon Daimyō" and "Demon King of the Sixth Heaven". Nobunaga was an influential figure in Japanese history and is regarded as one of the three great unifiers of Japan, along with his retainers, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu. Nobunaga paved the foundations for the successful reigns of Hideyoshi and Ieyasu. The period when Nobunaga and Hideyoshi were in power is called the Azuchi–Momoyama period. The name "Azuchi–Momoyama" comes from the fact that Nobunaga's castle, Azuchi Castle, was located in Azuchi, Shiga; while Fushimi Castle, where Hideyoshi lived after his retirement, was located in Momoyama. Nobunaga was head of the very powerful Oda clan and launched a war against other daimyō to unify Japan in the 1560s. Nobunaga emerged as the most powerful daimyō, overthrowing the nominally ruling shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki and dissolving the Ashikaga Shogunate in 1573. He conquered most of Honshu by 1580, and defeated the Ikkō-ikki rebels in the 1580s. Nobunaga's rule was noted for innovative military tactics, fostering of free trade, reforms of Japan's civil government, and the start of the Momoyama historical art period, but also for the brutal suppression of those who refused to cooperate or yield to his demands. Nobunaga killed himself during the Honnō-ji Incident in 1582, when his retainer Akechi Mitsuhide ambushed and trapped him in a temple in Kyoto; upon realizing he was surrounded, he committed seppuku. Nobunaga was succeeded by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who along with Tokugawa Ieyasu completed his war of unification shortly afterward.</p>

        <h2>Akechi Mitsuhide</h2>
        <div class="card-body">
        <img src="akechi.jpg" alt="akechi" width=360px height=360px>
        <p>Akechi Mitsuhide (明智光秀, March 10, 1528 – July 2, 1582), first called Jūbei from his clan and later Koretō Hyūga no Kami (惟任日向守) from his title, was a Japanese samurai general of the Sengoku period. Mitsuhide was originally a bodyguard of Ashikaga Yoshiaki and later, one of the trusted generals under daimyō Oda Nobunaga during his war of political unification in Japan. Mitsuhide rebelled against Nobunaga for unknown reasons in the Honnō-ji Incident in 1582, forcing the unprotected Nobunaga to commit seppuku in Kyoto. Mitsuhide attempted to establish himself as shōgun, but was pursued by Nobunaga's successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi and defeated at the Battle of Yamazaki. The 13-days short reign of Mitsuhide is listed as the inspiration for the yojijukugo set phrase mikkatenka. He is still popular in present culture. A ceremonial activity was held on April 15, 2018, in Kyoto. Why did Mitsuhide kill his lord Nobunaga? There are different opinions on the reason, and it has not yet been clarified. There is some speculation that Mitsuhide's move was not his own strategy, but someone else behind the scenes. Despite this, Mitsuhide, who eventually became a traitor, was labeled a "bad guy", and this negative image is still deeply rooted in people's hearts to this day. Mitsuhide's descendants cannot bear the surname Akechi and can only live in anonymity. If Mitsuhide had not gone to war with Nobunaga, Hideyoshi would not have unified the world, and the long Edo period (1603~1868) created by Tokugawa Ieyasu would not have been possible. The Tensho Koshirae was first forged during the Azuchi-Momoyama Era and was meant to be a replica of Akechi Mitsuhide's sword. These katanas were made for practical use and thus had a simplistic design philosophy and the metal tempered to be strong and durable. The Akechi family was able to trace their heritage to the Toki clan and from there to the Minamoto clan.</p>

        <h2>The Honnōji Incident</h2>
        <div class="card-body">
        <img src="honnoj.jpg" alt="honnoj" width=360px height=360px>
        <p>The Honnō-ji Incident (本能寺の変) was the assassination of Japanese daimyo Oda Nobunaga at Honnō-ji temple in Kyoto on 21 June 1582 (2nd day of the sixth month, Tenshō 10). Nobunaga was on the verge of unifying the country, but died in the unexpected rebellion of his vassal, Akechi Mitsuhide. Nobunaga only had a few guards and retainers with him when he was attacked, ending his Sengoku period campaign to unify Japan under his power. Nobunaga's death was avenged two weeks later when his retainer Toyotomi Hideyoshi defeated Mitsuhide in the Battle of Yamazaki, paving the way for Hideyoshi to complete the unification of Japan. Mitsuhide's motive for assassinating Nobunaga is unknown, though there are multiple theories for his betrayal. Due to Nobunaga's death, the reform of "breaking the old system and selecting talents regardless of family status" came to an abrupt end. Nobunaga's eldest son, Oda Nobutada, was also killed in the Honnoji Incident, which led to the internal division of the Oda family due to succession issues. The Honnōji Temple was rebuilt on a different site, which sits near the Kyōto Shiyakusho-mae Station. The actual site where Honnōji stood during the incident is a home for the elderly with a theme café dedicated to the incident. A small stone rod stands on the grounds of the original site. Despite Nobunaga’s remains never being found, his helmet was found and it sits on display in a small temple in Kiyosu.</p>
